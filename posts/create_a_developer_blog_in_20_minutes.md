For a real blog, we need a second page. Well, we could copy, paste & change our [first blog post]()</a>.

But we just need a new `<article>`. The `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` will be the same.

We could use wordpres, 11ty,...

But, we are developers, we can create out own static site generator.

    npm init -y
    npm i --save-dev nunjucks

Create a .gitignore file
Create a layout.html file
Create a build.js file
