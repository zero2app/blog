    Every developer should have a blog on the internet, they say. Ever heard of
    <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>? But hey, we're real developers,
    how hard could it be.
    There's not much we need to get started.
    <ul>
    <li>Some HTML</li>
    <li>A server on which the HTML is stored</li>
    <li>A deployment process to bring the HTML from our local machine to the server
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    That's an easy one. Have a look at the source of this page.
    <h3>Server</h3>
    We could use a shared hoster, static site hoster,....
    We are developers, so we choose git, github and github pages.
    Benefits are: it's free, version controlled, we have a backup.
    <h3>Deployment process</h3>
    <pre>
<code>git init
git add index.html
git commit -m "initial blog post"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:[USERNAME]/blog.git
git push -u origin main</code>
            </pre>
</p>
<p>
    Awesome! Your first blog post ist published. Have a look over
    <a href="https://zero2app.github.io/blog/">here</a> (Your site will be available at https://[USERNAME].github.io/blog/).
    Does not look so pretty yet. But hey, we are developers.
