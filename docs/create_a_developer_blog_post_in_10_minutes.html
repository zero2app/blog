      <p>Every developer should have a blog on the internet, they say. Ever heard of
<a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>? But hey, we're real developers,
how hard could it be.
There's not much we need to get started.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some HTML</li>
<li>A server on which the HTML is stored</li>
<li>A deployment process to bring the HTML from our local machine to the server</li>
</ul>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<p>That's an easy one. Have a look at the source of this page.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>We could use a shared hoster, static site hoster,....
We are developers, so we choose git, github and github pages.
Benefits are: it's free, version controlled, we have a backup.</p>
<h2>Deployment process</h2>
<pre><code>git init
git add index.html
git commit -m &quot;initial blog post&quot;
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:[USERNAME]/blog.git
git push -u origin main
</code></pre>
<p>Awesome! Your first blog post ist published. Have a look over
<a href="https://zero2app.github.io/blog/">here</a> (Your site will be available at https://[USERNAME].github.io/blog/).
Does not look so pretty yet. But hey, we are developers.</p>
